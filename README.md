# Lab 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Setting the Environment

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning (ML).
- Set up the Python development environment using Anaconda.
- Install and use essential ML libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## 📘 Introduction

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

ML is used in:
- Image and speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Predictive analytics
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learns from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns from feedback by interacting with an environment.

Python is the most popular language for ML due to its readability and ecosystem of libraries. **Anaconda** provides a robust and easy-to-manage ML environment.
